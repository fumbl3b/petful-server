### Summary

Petful is a hypothetical site for an animal shelter to allows adoption of cats and dogs. The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first. In addition, people who want to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when it's their turn.

### Technologies

Petful's client is written in React.js.  The API utilizes both Node and Express.  The server uses Linked Lists to create and store user/pet information.
